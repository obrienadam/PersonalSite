            <h3>Motivation</h3>

            <p>
                Fluid-fluid interfaces play a dominant role in the behaviour of many industrial processes, in particular
                those that involve the coating (wetting) or separation (de-wetting) of particles. Examples of such
                processes include the extraction of bitumen from the tar sands, fabrication by ink-jet printing, drug
                delivery from micro- and nano-capsules, production of food such as ice cream and the stabilization of
                foams and emulsions. As such, developing a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics behind
                particles at fluid-fluid interfaces has obvious economic upside. Also, as environmental regulations
                around the world become stricter, there is pressure to move away from the use of traditional synthetic
                surfactants to control interface stability and substitute environmentally friendly alternatives. One
                such promising alternative is the use of biodegradable micro- or nano-particles that become trapped at
                the fluid-fluid interface. To date, the study of particles at fluid-fluid interfaces has been largely
                relegated to experiments. The increasing availability of computational resources, as well as improved
                numerical algorithms, makes the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) another attractive alternative
                for a fundamental study of particles at fluid-fluid interfaces. The advantages of CFD include a high
                degree of control over simulation conditions, as well as the ability to extract any solution variables of
                interest from the domain with much greater ease than taking experimental measurements. Many algorithmic
                challenges exist, however, in particular the moving boundary problem for finite size particles. While
                attempts have been made to address this issue through the use of a re-meshing scheme, Immersed Boundary
                (IB) methods are another possibility for modelling the solid particles within the computational domain,
                which enjoy a considerable advantage in terms of time relative to re-meshing approaches.
            </p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>

            <p>
                The objective of this research is to investigate the interactions of particles near immiscible
                fluid-fluid interfaces, by developing a multiphase flow solver complete with a Direct Forcing (DF)
                immersed boundary method, which is capable of resolving the coupling between the flow solver and the
                solid body motion of the particle. The IB method to be used will be similar to Fluid-Structure
                Interaction (FSI) solver of Calderer et al., with the interfacial body forces computed in the manner
                proposed by Montazeri et al.. In addition to this, it is proposed to develop a fully coupled implicit
                framework such as those developed by Denner et al. and Darwish et al., rather than employ the standard
                approach to IB simulations where an un-coupled algorithm such as SIMPLE is used. The motivation behind
                this is to improve the coupling between body forces and the pressure field, which is key in reducing the
                magnitude of spurious currents in simulations with fluid-fluid interfaces. To the best of my knowledge,
                no such attempt to develop a fully-implicit, coupled solver for the solution of fluid-particle
                interactions at a fluid-fluid interfaces using an IB method has been made. In addition to the
                development of the solver, a number of applications will be investigated, in particular attempting to
                simulate various common experimental scenarios. The study of such experimental cases serves as both a
                method of validation for the numerical solver, as well as a method for studying fluid-particle
                interactions at fluid-fluid interfaces on scales that would be very difficult experimentally, perhaps
                providing new insight into the underlying physics.

            <h3>Current Progress</h3>

            <p>
                To date, a fully three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes solver, similar to the framework
                proposed by Darwish et al. has been developed with immersed boundary capability. The immersed boundary
                method is based on a direct forcing approach similar to that proposed by Borazjani et al.. The framework,
                denoted as “Computational Algorithms Framework for Fluid Equations” (CAFFE), serves as a lightweight
                platform for the development and testing of immersed boundary approaches and numerical solvers. The
                solver uses a Dual Time-Stepping (DTS) scheme, with a Generalized Minimum RESidual (GMRES) iterative
                technique used to solve each of the sparse sets of linear equations arising from the momentum and
                pressure poisson equation at each inner iteration. In order to solve linear equations, the parallel
                GMRES solvers in the freely available PETSc library are used.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to the development of the above framework, simulations conducted using OpenFOAM with
                immersed boundaries have been conducted for simple cases of flow around a cylinders/spheres. As the
                project progresses, development will be focused around the OpenFOAM framework, due to the broad
                availability of numerical tools within.
