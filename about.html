            <h3>Background</h3>

            <p>
                Adam Oâ€™Brien received his BASc in aerospace engineering from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada in
                2012, and MASc in aerospace engineering from the
                University of Toronto, Canada in 2014.
                He is currently working towards his PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the
                University of Toronto, focusing on developing software for the simulation of
                particle-laden multiphase flows, with applications in oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and the food industry. In the past, he has also worked on a developing
                software for the simulation of combusting flows with acoustics and incompressible simulations of wind
                turbine airfoils. As an avid software enthusiast, he
                has also undertaken several large projects including a particle-tree code for astrophysical simulations,
                a panel method code with real-time OpenGL rendering
                and a python-based incompressible CFD code complete with a GUI and built-in
                post-processing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through a wide range of computational projects, he has gained considerable
                experience in developing applications for running on MPI based distributed
                computing systems as well as multi-threaded applications, and recently began
                working with NuPhysics developing applications for the Intel&reg; Xeon Phi&trade; coprocessor, based on
                their Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture.
            </p>

            <h3>Research Interests</h3>

            <p>
                His research interests are centered around computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of multi-phase flows
                around
                particle clusters modelled using the immersed boundary (IB) method, working under the supervision of
                Professor Markus Bussmann at the University of Toronto Department of Mechanical and Industrial
                Engineering (MIE). He specializes in developing parallel CFD software and open source software. In
                particular, he is interested in applications related to interfacial flows in the presence of particles,
                which are commonly encountered in industries such as oil and gas, pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals and
                food. The primary focus of his research is developing robust numerical software for solving
                incompressible multiphase flows, with complex geometries modelled using the immersed boundary (IB)
                method rather than traditional unstructured meshes.
